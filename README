What do we do
#####
Basically we need to download data from the website. Since the data files are too big, I failed to download all of them. So, what I decided to do was to test the functionality I implemented as building blocks for this task.
The idea to achieve the goal is that we need to clean up the dataset first in order to make it smaller but keep all useful data. There is a function in my program to do it. It sums up a 3-gram and keep one entry for it. The search speed is much better than 
before.
The second step was to build a tool to search according to a rule. I defined rules as "match first", "match second", "match third", "match second and third"(as required), "match all" and "match any". (function written, not fully tested)
The third step would be using the tool to build the essay. (not done)

How to do
#####
1. DOWNLOAD THE DATA
   ./Download.sh
   after download it, we could cat them together.

2. Compile
   gcc EssayMaker.c -o EssayMaker
 
3. Clean up the data
   ./EssayMaker clean <filename> > <cleaned file>
   NOTE: there is bug: the first line of the output file should be removed.
 
4. The search tool
   ./EssayMaker seearch <filename> 
   NOTE: as it is unfinished the rule currently is hard coded as match second "POEM".
